## Part One
Build an application using grunt to get data from the following API: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nss-day-cohort-31/national-parks/master/database.json.

1. display the list of national parks on the DOM. 
1. Each national park should be formatted in HTML like below:

```
<article>
      <h3>Park Name</h3>
      <p>State the park in located in</p>
    </article>
 ```
1. If the park has been visited, the article tag should have a red dashed border. If the park has not been visited, it should have a green solid border.

## Part Two
1. For each of the national parks, use the latitude and longitude to get the weather.
1. Use this API: https://darksky.net/dev.
1. From the data coming back from the Dark Sky API, you are going to use `summary` listed under `currently`, `hourly` and `daily`. 

Change your original html to look like this:

```
<article>
      <h3>Park Name</h3>
      <p>State the park</p>
      <p>Weather:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Currently: Summary from currently in API Data</li>
        <li>Today: Summary from hourly in API Data</li>
        <li>Week: Summary from daily in API Data</li>
      </ul>
</article>
```

If you encounter CORS issues with the Dark Sky API, you can either get an extension for Chrome to work around it here:
* https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc 
* OR you can use this url instead: ` https://blooming-mesa-53816.herokuapp.com/37.8267,-122.4233` (be sure to replace the lat and lon values in the url with your own)
